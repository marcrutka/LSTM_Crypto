# üìà Bitcoin Price Prediction using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

## Overview
This project predicts Bitcoin prices using an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network**, a type of **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** designed for time-series forecasting. The model supports both **single-step and multi-step predictions**, forecasting BTC/USD prices up to 24 hours ahead.

## Features
‚úÖ Fetches historical **BTC/USD** price data using Yahoo Finance  
‚úÖ Preprocesses data with **MinMaxScaler** for better neural network performance  
‚úÖ Implements **single-step** and **multi-step** forecasting  
‚úÖ Uses an **LSTM model** to learn from past price movements  
‚úÖ Visualizes **actual vs. predicted prices** with Matplotlib  
‚úÖ Evaluates model performance using **MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**  

## Technologies Used
- **Python** üêç
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (LSTM model training)
- **scikit-learn** (data preprocessing & evaluation)
- **pandas & numpy** (data handling)
- **matplotlib** (data visualization)
- **Yahoo Finance API** (retrieving historical Bitcoin prices)

## Installation & Usage
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash

   cd LSTM_Crypto.ipynb
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**
